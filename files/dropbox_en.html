    <h2>Dropbox Terms of Service</h2>

    <p>Last Modified: July 6, 2011</p>

    <p>Thank you for using Dropbox! These terms of service (the &#147;<b>Terms</b>&#148;) govern your access to and use of Dropbox (&#147;<b>we</b>&#148; or &#147;<b>our</b>&#148;) websites and services (the &#147;<b>Services</b>&#148;), so please carefully read them before using the Services.</p>

    <p><b>By using the Services you agree to be bound by these Terms</b>. If you are using the Services on behalf of an organization, you are agreeing to these Terms for that organization and promising that you have the authority to bind that organization to these terms. In that case, &#147;you&#148; and &#147;your&#148; will refer to that organization.<p>

    <p>You may use the Services only in compliance with these Terms. You may use the Services only if you have the power to form a contract with Dropbox and are not barred under any applicable laws from doing so. The Services may continue to change over time as we refine and add more features. We may stop, suspend, or modify the Services at any time without prior notice to you. We may also remove any content from our Services at our discretion.</p>
    
    <h2>Your Stuff & Your Privacy</h2>

    <p>By using our Services you provide us with information, files, and folders that you submit to Dropbox (together, “your stuff”).  You retain full ownership to your stuff.  We don’t claim any ownership to any of it.  These Terms do not grant us any rights to your stuff or intellectual property except for the limited rights that are needed to run the Services, as explained below.</p>

    <p>We may need your permission to do things you ask us to do with your stuff, for example, hosting your files, or sharing them at your direction.  This includes product features visible to you, for example, image thumbnails or document previews.  It also includes design choices we make to technically administer our Services, for example, how we redundantly backup data to keep it safe.  You give us the permissions we need to do those things solely to provide the Services.   This permission also extends to trusted third parties we work with to provide the Services, for example Amazon, which provides our storage space (again, only to provide the Services).</p>

    <p>To be clear, aside from the rare exceptions we identify in our <a href='/privacy'>Privacy Policy</a>, no matter how the Services change, we won’t share your content with others, including law enforcement, for any purpose unless you direct us to.  How we collect and use your information generally is also explained in our <a href='/privacy'>Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
    
    <p>You are solely responsible for your conduct, the content of your files and folders, and your communications with others while using the Services.  For example, it’s your responsibility to ensure that you have the rights or permission needed to comply with these Terms.</p>

    <p>We may choose to review public content for compliance with our community guidelines, but you acknowledge that Dropbox has no obligation to monitor any information on the Services.  We are not responsible for the accuracy, completeness, appropriateness, or legality of files, user posts, or any other information you may be able to access using the Services.</p>

    <h2>Sharing Your Stuff</h2>

    <p>The Services provide features that allow you to share your stuff with others or to make it public. There are many things that users may do with that stuff (for example, copy it, modify it, re-share it). Please consider carefully what you choose to share or make public. Dropbox has no responsibility for that activity.</p>

    <h2>Your Responsibilities</h2>

    <p>Files and other content in the Services may be protected by intellectual property rights of others. Please do not copy, upload, download, or share files unless you have the right to do so. You, not Dropbox, will be fully responsible and liable for what you copy, share, upload, download or otherwise use while using the Services. You must not upload spyware or any other malicious software to the Service. </p>

    <p>You, and not Dropbox, are responsible for maintaining and protecting all of your stuff. Dropbox will not be liable for any loss or corruption of your stuff, or for any costs or expenses associated with backing up or restoring any of your stuff.</p>

    <p>If your contact information, or other information related to your account, changes, you must notify us promptly and keep your information current. The Services are not intended for use by you if you are under 13 years of age. By agreeing to these Terms, you are representing to us that you are over 13.</p>

    <h2>Account Security</h2>

    <p>You are responsible for safeguarding the password that you use to access the Services and you agree not to disclose your password to any third party. You are responsible for any activity using your account, whether or not you authorized that activity. You should immediately notify Dropbox of any unauthorized use of your account. You acknowledge that if you wish to protect your transmission of data or files to Dropbox, it is your responsibility to use a secure encrypted connection to communicate with the Services.</p>
    
    <h2>Software and Updates</h2>
    
    <p>Some use of our Service requires you to download a client software package (&#147;Software&#148;). Dropbox hereby grants you a limited, nonexclusive, nontransferable, revocable license to use the Software, solely to access 
the Services. Your license to use the Software is automatically revoked if you violate these Terms in a manner that implicates our intellectual property rights. We hereby reserve all rights not expressly granted in these Terms. You must not reverse engineer or decompile the Software, nor attempt to do so, nor assist anyone else to do so. Our Services may update the Software on your device automatically when a new version is available. Our pause syncing feature pauses syncing of your files, but may not cease all data transfer, so you should exit the desktop client if you’d like to stop data transfer.</p>

    <h2>Dropbox Property and Feedback</h2>

    <p>These terms do not grant you any right, title, or interest in the Services, Software, or the content in the Services. While we appreciate it when users send us feedback, please be aware that we may use any feedback, comments, or suggestions you send us or post in our forums without any obligation to you. The Software and other technology we use to provide the Services are protected by copyright, trademark, and other laws of both the United States and foreign countries. These Terms do not grant you any rights to use the Dropbox trademarks, logos, domain names, or other brand features.</p>

    <h2>Acceptable Use Policy</h2>

    <p>You will not, and will not attempt to, misuse the Services, and will use the Services only in a manner consistent with the Dropbox <a href='/acceptable_use'>Acceptable Use Policy</a>.</p>

    <h2>Copyright</h2>

    <p>Dropbox respects others’ intellectual property and asks that you do too. We will respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement if they comply with the law and are properly provided to us. Such notices should be reported using our <a href='/dmca'>DMCA Process</a>. We reserve the right to delete or disable content alleged to be infringing and to terminate repeat infringers. Our designated agent for notice of alleged copyright infringement on the Services is:</p>

    <p>
       Copyright Agent<br>
       Dropbox Inc.<br>
       760 Market Street #1150<br>
       San Francisco, CA 94102<br>
       copyright@dropbox.com<br>
    </p>

    <h2>Other Content</h2>
    
    <p>The Services may contain links to third-party websites or resources. Dropbox does not endorse and is not responsible or liable for their availability, accuracy, the related content, products, or services. You are solely responsible for your use of any such websites or resources. Also, if we provide you with any software under an open source license, there may be provisions in those licenses that expressly conflict with these Terms, in which case the open source provisions will apply.</p>

    <h2>Termination</h2>

    <p>Though we’d much rather you stay, you can stop using our Services any time. We reserve the right to suspend or end the Services at any time, with or without cause, and with or without notice. For example, we may suspend or terminate your use if you are not complying with these Terms, or use the Services in any way that would cause us legal liability or disrupt others’ use of the Services. If we suspend or terminate your use, we will try to let you know in advance and help you retrieve data, though there may be some cases (for example, repeatedly or flagrantly violating these Terms, a court order, or danger to other users) where we may suspend immediately.</p>
    
    <h2>Dropbox is Available &#147;AS-IS&#148;</h2>

    <p>Though we want to provide a great service, there are certain things about the service we can’t promise. For example, THE SERVICES AND SOFTWARE ARE PROVIDED &#147;AS IS&#148;, AT YOUR OWN RISK, WITHOUT EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTY OR CONDITION OF ANY KIND. WE ALSO DISCLAIM ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT. (We are not shouting- it’s just that these disclaimers are really important, so we want to highlight them). Dropbox will have no responsibility for any harm to your computer system, loss or corruption of data, or other harm that results from your access to or use of the Services or Software. Some states do not allow the types of disclaimers in this paragraph, so they may not apply to you. </p>

    <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
    
    <p>TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL DROPBOX, ITS AFFILIATES, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, SUPPLIERS OR LICENSORS BE LIABLE FOR (A) ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY OR CONSEQUENTIAL (INCLUDING LOSS OF USE, DATA, BUSINESS, OR PROFITS) DAMAGES, REGARDLESS OF LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER OR NOT DROPBOX HAS BEEN WARNED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, AND EVEN IF A REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE; (B) AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR ALL CLAIMS RELATING TO THE SERVICES MORE THAN THE GREATER OF $20 OR THE AMOUNTS PAID BY YOU TO DROPBOX FOR THE PAST THREE MONTHS OF THE SERVICES IN QUESTION. Some states do not allow the types of limitations in this paragraph, so they may not apply to you.</p>
    
    <h2>Export Restrictions</h2>

    <p>The export and re-export of the Software may be controlled by the United States Export Administration Regulations. The Software may not be used in Cuba; Iran; North Korea; Sudan; or Syria or any country that is subject to an embargo by the United States. If you are a resident or national of, or a business located in, any of those countries, you may not download or use the Software. In addition, the Software may not be distributed to persons on the Table of Denial Orders; the Entity List; or the List of Specially Designated Nationals.</p>

    <h2>Modifications</h2>

    <p>We may revise these Terms from time to time and the most current version will always be posted on our website. If a revision, in our sole discretion, is material we will notify you (for example via email to the email address associated with your account). Other changes may be posted to our blog or terms page, so please check those pages regularly. By continuing to access or use the Services after revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised Terms. If you do not agree to the new terms, please stop using the Services.</p>

    <h2>Miscellaneous Legal Terms</h2>

    <p>THESE TERMS AND THE USE OF THE SERVICES AND SOFTWARE WILL BE GOVERNED BY CALIFORNIA LAW EXCEPT FOR ITS CONFLICTS OF LAWS PRINCIPLES. ALL CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THESE TERMS OR THE SERVICES OR SOFTWARE MUST BE LITIGATED EXCLUSIVELY IN THE FEDERAL OR STATE COURTS OF SAN FRANCISCO COUNTY, CALIFORNIA, AND BOTH PARTIES CONSENT TO VENUE AND PERSONAL JURISDICTION THERE. These Terms constitute the entire and exclusive agreement between you and Dropbox with respect to the Services, and supersede and replace any other agreements, terms and conditions applicable to the Services. These Terms create no third party beneficiary rights. Dropbox’s failure to enforce a provision is not a waiver of its right to do so later. If a provision is found unenforceable the remaining provisions of the Agreement will remain in full effect and an enforceable term will be substituted reflecting our intent as closely as possible. You may not assign any of your rights in these Terms, and any such attempt is void, but Dropbox may assign its rights to any of its affiliates or subsidiaries, or to any successor in interest of any business associated with the Services. Dropbox and you are not legal partners or agents; instead, our relationship is that of independent contractors.</p>

     <h2>Dropbox Privacy Policy</h2>
     
     <p>Last Modified: July 2, 2011</p>

     <p>This Privacy Policy provides our policies and procedures for collecting, using, and disclosing your information. Users can access the Dropbox service (the “<b>Service</b>”) through our website www.dropbox.com, applications on Devices, through APIs, and through third-parties.  A “<b>Device</b>” is any computer used to access the Dropbox Service, including without limitation a desktop, laptop, mobile phone, tablet, or other consumer electronic device.  This Privacy Policy governs your access of the Dropbox Service, regardless of how you access it, and by using our Services you consent to the collection, transfer, processing, storage, disclosure and other uses described in this Privacy Policy.  All of the different forms of data, content, and information described below are collectively referred to as “information.”</p> 

     <h2>1. The Information We Collect And Store</h2>
     <p>We may collect and store the following information when running the Dropbox Service:</p>

     <p><span class='slugline'>Information You Provide.</span> &nbsp; When you register an account, we collect some personal information, such as your name, phone number, credit card or other billing information, email address and home and business postal addresses. You may also ask us to import your contacts by giving us access to your third party services (for example, your email account) or to use your social networking information if you give us access to your account on social network connection services.  You may also provide us with your contacts’ email addresses when sharing folders or files with them.</p>

     <p><span class='slugline'>Files.</span> &nbsp; We collect and store the files you upload, download, or access with the Dropbox Service (“<b>Files</b>”).  If you add a file to your Dropbox that has been previously uploaded by you or another user, we may associate all or a portion of the previous file with your account rather than storing a duplicate.</p>
     
     <p><span class='slugline'>Log Data.</span> &nbsp;  When you use the Service, we automatically record information from your Device, its software, and your activity using the Services. This may include the Device’s Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, browser type, the web page visited before you came to our website, information you search for on our website, locale preferences, identification numbers associated with your Devices, your mobile carrier, date and time stamps associated with transactions, system configuration information, metadata concerning your Files, and other interactions with the Service.</p>

     <p><span class='slugline'>Cookies.</span> &nbsp; We also use “cookies” to collect information and improve our Services. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your Device. We may use “persistent cookies” to save your registration ID and login password for future logins to the Service. We may use “session ID cookies” to enable certain features of the Service, to better understand how you interact with the Service and to monitor aggregate usage and web traffic routing on the Service. You can instruct your browser, by changing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all aspects of the Service. </p>

     <h2>2. How We Use Personal Information</h2>
     <p><span class='slugline'>Personal Information:</span> &nbsp; In the course of using the Service, we may collect personal information that can be used to contact or identify you (“<b>Personal Information</b>”). Personal Information is or may be used: (i) to provide and improve our Service, (ii) to administer your use of the Service, (iii) to better understand your needs and interests, (iv) to personalize and improve your experience, and (v) to provide or offer software updates and product announcements. If you no longer wish to receive communications from us, please follow the “unsubscribe” instructions provided in any of those communications, or update your <a href='https://www.dropbox.com/account#settings'>account settings</a> information.</p>

     <p><span class='slugline'>Geo-Location Information:</span> &nbsp; Some Devices allow applications to access real-time location-based information (for example, GPS).  Our mobile apps do not collect such information as of the date this policy went into effect, but may do so in the future with your consent to improve our Services.  Some photos you place in Dropbox may contain recorded location information.  We may use this information to optimize your experience.  Also, some of the information we collect from a Device, for example IP address, can sometimes be used to approximate a Device’s location.</p>

     <p><span class='slugline'>Analytics:</span> &nbsp; We also collect some information (ourselves or using third party services) using logging and cookies, which can sometimes be correlated with Personal Information.  We use this information for the above purposes and to monitor and analyze use of the Service, for the Service’s technical administration, to increase our Service’s functionality and user-friendliness, and to verify users have the authorization needed for the Service to process their requests.  As of the date this policy went into effect, we use Google Analytics.   To learn more about the privacy policy of Google Analytics, click <a href='http://www.google.com/intl/en/analytics/privacyoverview.html'>here</a>, and to learn how to opt out of that service click <a href='http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en'>here</a>.</p>
     
     <h2>3. Information Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
     <p><span class='slugline'>Your Use.</span> &nbsp; We will display your Personal Information in your profile page and elsewhere on the Service according to the preferences you set in your account. Any information you choose to provide should reflect how much you want others to know about you. Please consider carefully what information you disclose in your profile page and your desired level of anonymity. You can review and revise your profile information at any time. We may also share or disclose your information with your consent, for example if you use a third party application to access your account (see below). Through certain features of the Service, you may also have the ability to make some of your information public.  Public information may be broadly and quickly disseminated.</p>

     <p><span class='slugline'>Service Providers, Business Partners and Others.</span> &nbsp; We may use certain trusted third party companies and individuals to help us provide, analyze, and improve the Service (including but not limited to data storage, maintenance services, database management, web analytics, payment processing, and improvement of the Service’s features). These third parties may have access to your information only for purposes of performing these tasks on our behalf and under obligations similar to those in this Privacy Policy.  As of the date this policy went into effect, we use Amazon’s S3 storage service to store some of your information (for example, your Files).  You can find more information on Amazon's data security from the <a href='http://aws.amazon.com/articles/1697'>S3 site</a> or, read more about <a href='https://www.dropbox.com/help/7'>how Dropbox and Amazon securely store data</a>.

     <p><span class='slugline'>Third-Party Applications.</span> &nbsp; We may share your information with a third party application with your consent, for example when you choose to access our Services through such an application.  We are not responsible for what those parties do with your information, so you should make sure you trust the application and that it has a privacy policy acceptable to you.</p>

     <p><span class='slugline'>Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement Requests; Protection of Dropbox's Rights.</span> &nbsp; We may disclose to parties outside Dropbox files stored in your Dropbox and information about you that we collect when we have a good faith belief that disclosure is reasonably necessary to (a) comply with a law, regulation or compulsory legal request; (b) protect the safety of any person from death or serious bodily injury; (c) prevent fraud or abuse of Dropbox or its users; or (d) to protect Dropbox’s property rights. If we provide your Dropbox files to a law enforcement agency as set forth above, we will remove Dropbox’s encryption from the files before providing them to law enforcement. However, Dropbox will not be able to decrypt any files that you encrypted prior to storing them on Dropbox.</p>

     <p><span class='slugline'>Business Transfers.</span> &nbsp; If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of our assets, your information may be transferred as part of that transaction, but we will notify you (for example, via email and/or a prominent notice on our website) of any change in control or use of your Personal Information or Files, or if either become subject to a different Privacy Policy.  We will also notify you of choices you may have regarding the information.</p>

     <p><span class='slugline'>Non-private or Non-Personal Information.</span> &nbsp; We may disclose your non-private, aggregated, or otherwise non-personal information, such as usage statistics of our Service. </p>

     <h2>4. Changing or Deleting Your Information</h2>
     <p>If you are a registered user, you may review, update, correct or delete the Personal Information provided in your registration or account profile by changing your “account settings.” If your personally identifiable information changes, or if you no longer desire our service, you may update or delete it by making the change on your <a href='https://www.dropbox.com/account#settings'>account settings</a>.  In some cases we may retain copies of your information if required by law.</p>

     <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
     <p>We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services. If you wish to cancel your account or request that we no longer use your information to provide you services, you may delete your account <a href='https://www.dropbox.com/account/delete'>here</a>.  We may retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.  Consistent with these requirements, we will try to delete your information quickly upon request.  Please note, however, that there might be latency in deleting information from our servers and backed-up versions might exist after deletion.  In addition, we do not delete from our servers files that you have in common with other users.</p>

     <h2>6. Dropbox Community</h2>
     <p>Our Service offers publicly accessible community services such as blogs, forums, and wikis. You should be aware that any information you provide in these areas may be read, collected, and used by others who access them.  Your posts may remain even after you cancel your account.</p>

     <h2>7. Security</h2>
     <p>The security of your information is important to us.  When you enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number) on our order forms, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). </p>

     <p>We follow generally accepted standards to protect the information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.  No method of electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure, however.  Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you have any questions about security on our website, you can view our <a href='https://www.dropbox.com/security'>Security Overview Page</a> or contact us at <a href='mailto:security@dropbox.com'>security@dropbox.com</a>.</p>

     <h2>8. Our Policy Toward Children</h2>
     <p>Our Services are not directed to persons under 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with Personal Information without their consent, he or she should contact us at <a href='mailto:privacy@dropbox.com'>privacy@dropbox.com</a>. If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with Personal Information, we will take steps to delete such information from our files.</p>

     <h2>9. Contacting Us</h2>
     <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at <a href='mailto:privacy@dropbox.com'>privacy@dropbox.com</a>.</p>

     <h2>10. Changes to our Privacy Policy</h2>
     <p>This Privacy Policy may change from time to time.  If we make a change to this privacy policy that we believe materially reduces your rights, we will provide you with notice (for example, by email).  And we may provide notice of changes in other circumstances as well.  By continuing to use the Service after those changes become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised Privacy Policy.</p>

<div id="pricing-terms">
        <h2>Pricing Terms and Conditions</h2>

        <h5>Premium Accounts</h5>
        <p>
            Dropbox offers you the option of increasing your account storage space beyond 2 GB for a fee. By doing so, your account will be converted to a Premium Account and will not be subject to the restrictions placed on Free Accounts as described below.
        </p>
        <p>
            Dropbox accepts credit cards and will automatically charge your credit card monthly or yearly, depending upon which Premium Account you select. If any fee is not paid in a timely manner, or Dropbox is unable to process your transaction using the credit card information provided, Dropbox reserves the right to revoke access to your Dropbox account and Files. If you do not bring your Dropbox balance current within five (5) days after Dropbox provides you with notification that your account is in arrears, Dropbox reserves the right to use our discretion to delete some or all of Your Files so as to reduce your storage space to below 2 GB, and to convert your Dropbox Premium Account to a Free Account (which is subject to the restrictions described below).  
        </p>

        <h5>Billing</h5>
        <p>
            The fees for your Premium Account will be billed from the date you elect, or convert to,  a Premium Account and on each monthly or yearly renewal thereafter unless and until you cancel your account. Click on the link on your "Account" page to see the commencement date for your next renewal period. Dropbox will automatically bill your credit card each month or year on the calendar day corresponding to the commencement of your Premium Account. In the event your Premium Account began on a day not contained in a given month or year, Dropbox will bill your credit card on the last day of such month or year. For example, if your Premium Account began on January 31st, February 28th is the next time your credit card would be billed. You acknowledge that the amount billed each month or year may vary for reasons that include, differing amounts due to promotional offers, differing amounts due to changes in your account, or changes in the amount of applicable sales tax, and you authorize us to charge your credit card for such varying amounts. Dropbox may also periodically authorize your credit card in anticipation of account or related charges. All fees and charges are nonrefundable and there are no refunds or credits for partially used periods. 
        </p>
        <p>    
            Should you elect to upgrade your Premium Account to a larger amount of storage space, the commencement date for your next renewal period will be reset and you will be billed for the first month or year of the upgraded level of service on a pro-rata basis. For example, if you begin your monthly billed Premium Account on February 15th, your next payment would be due on March 15th. On March 22, you upgrade your Premium Account to a larger amount of storage space and pay the new amount associated with the upgraded Premium Account you have selected, less the amount equal to 7 days at your previous Premium Account rate. Your next payment would then be due on April 22.  
        </p>
        <p>
            Dropbox may change the fees and charges in effect, or add new fees and charges from time to time, but we will give you advance notice of these changes by email. If you want to use a different credit card or if there is a change in your credit card validity or expiration date, you may edit your information by accessing your "Account" page. If your credit card reaches its expiration date, your continued use of the Dropbox constitutes your authorization for us to continue billing that credit card and you remain responsible for any uncollected amounts. It is your responsibility to keep your contact information and payment information current and updated.
        </p>

        <h5>Cancelling Your Account</h5>
        <p>
            Your Dropbox Premium Account will continue in effect unless and until you cancel your Premium Account or we terminate it. You must cancel your Premium Account before it renews each month or year in order to avoid billing of the next month's or year's fees to your credit card. Dropbox will bill the monthly or yearly fees associated with your Premium Account plus any applicable tax to the credit card you provide to us during registration (or to a different credit card if you change your account information).
        </p>
        <p>
            Dropbox Premium Accounts are prepaid and are non-refundable. DROPBOX DOES NOT PROVIDE REFUNDS OR CREDITS FOR ANY PARTIAL MONTHS OR YEARS. You may cancel your Dropbox Premium Account at anytime, and cancellation will be effective immediately. If you wish to cancel your Premium Account you may do so via your "Account" page. Should you elect to cancel your Premium Account, please note that you will not be issued a refund for the most recently (or any previously) charged monthly fees.
        </p>

        <p>
            By signing up for a Dropbox Premium Account and providing Dropbox with your payment account information, you hereby agree to these payment terms and conditions.
        </p>

        <h5>Free Accounts</h5>
        <p>
            Dropbox allows you to store up to 2 GB free of charge.  Dropbox reserves the right to terminate Free Accounts at any time, with or without notice.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, if a Free Account is inactive for ninety (90) days, then Dropbox may delete any or all of Your Files without providing additional notice.
        </p>
        <p>

<div id="security-overview">
    <h2>Security Overview</h2>
    <p>We provide this overview so that you can better understand the security measures we’ve put in place to protect the information that you store using Dropbox.</p>

    <h2>Secure Storage</h2>
    <p>We encrypt the files that you store on Dropbox using the AES-256 standard, which is the same encryption standard used by banks to secure customer data. Encryption for storage is applied after files are uploaded, and we manage the encryption keys.</p>
    <p>Dropbox uses Amazon S3 for data storage. Amazon stores data over several large-scale data centers. According to Amazon, they use military grade perimeter control berms, video surveillance, and professional security staff to keep their data centers physically secure.</p>
    <p>You can find more information about Amazon's security at the <a href='http://aws.amazon.com/security/'>Amazon Web Services' website</a>.</p>
    <p>Amazon and Dropbox also employ significant protection against network security issues such as Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, Man in the Middle (MITM) attacks, and packet sniffing.</p>

    <h2>Secure Transfers</h2>
    <p>Your files are sent between Dropbox’s desktop clients and our servers over a secure channel using 256-bit SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) encryption, the standard for secure Internet network connections.</p>
    <p>Your files are sent between Dropbox’s mobile apps and our servers over a secure channel using 256-bit SSL encryption where supported.  Not all mobile media players support encrypted streaming, so media files streamed from our servers are not always encrypted.</p>

    <h2>Your Data is Backed Up</h2>
    <p>Dropbox and Amazon keep redundant backups of all data over multiple locations to prevent the remote possibility of data loss. In the unlikely event that this redundancy were to fail, Dropbox folders linked to a desktop computer client will still contain copies of your files (except files you’ve chosen not to sync using Selective Sync).</p>

    <h2>Privacy</h2>
    <p>A copy of our full privacy policy can be found at: <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/privacy">https://www.dropbox.com/privacy</a>.</p>
    <p>We guard your privacy to the best of our ability and work hard to protect your information from unauthorized access.</p>
    <p>Dropbox employees are prohibited from viewing the content of files you store in your Dropbox account, and are only permitted to view file metadata (e.g., file names and locations). Like most online services, we have a small number of employees who must be able to access user data for the reasons stated in our privacy policy (e.g., when legally required to do so). But that’s the rare exception, not the rule. We have strict policy and technical access controls that prohibit employee access except in these rare circumstances. In addition, we employ a number of physical and electronic security measures to protect user information from unauthorized access.</p>

    <h2>Third-party Apps</h2>
    <p>If you choose to access Dropbox using third-party applications (“apps”), be aware that those apps utilize their own security protocols and have their own privacy policies.  If you’re not comfortable with the privacy and security features of those apps, you shouldn’t use them to access Dropbox. For example, third-party apps might not employ encryption when transmitting data, might collect information that Dropbox does not, and might use information differently than Dropbox does.</p>
    
    <h2>Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement</h2>
    <p>As set forth in our privacy policy, and in compliance with United States law, Dropbox cooperates with United States law enforcement when it receives valid legal process, which may require Dropbox to provide the contents of your private Dropbox. In these cases, Dropbox will remove Dropbox’s encryption from the files before providing them to law enforcement.</p>
    
    <h2>How to Add Your Own Layer of Encryption to Dropbox</h2>
    <p>Dropbox applies encryption to your files after they have been uploaded, and we manage the encryption keys. Users who wish to manage their own encryption keys can apply encryption before placing files in their Dropbox. Please note that if you encrypt files before uploading them, some features will not be available, such as creating public links.  Doing so will also make it impossible for us to recover your data if you lose your encryption key.</p>
    
    <h2>I think I've found a security exploit. Where do I report security concerns?</h2>
    <p>We take a number of measures to ensure that the data you store on Dropbox is safe and secure. While we're very confident in our technology, we recognize that no system can guarantee data security with 100% certainty. For that reason, we will continue to innovate to make sure that our security measures are state of the art, and we will investigate any and all reported security issues concerning Dropbox's services or software. For a direct line to our security experts, report security issues to <a href="mailto:security@dropbox.com">security@dropbox.com</a>.</p>
