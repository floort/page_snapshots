     <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>When you register for a Sony Entertainment Network (“SEN”) account, access or use PlayStation®Network (“PSN”), including PlayStation®Store, online gaming, messaging and virtual communities, Sony Computer Entertainment Hong Kong Limited will collect personal information about you.  This Privacy Policy tells you how we will use this information and how you can contact us about this.  By registering a SEN Master Account, or by having an associated Sub Account registered for you, or by accessing or using PSN, you agree to be bound by the terms of, and consent to the use and disclosure of your personal information as contemplated by, our Privacy Policy as set out below.</p>
    <h3>What information do we collect?</h3>
     <p>When you register with SEN, we collect information from you, such as your name, email address, postal address, country, date of birth/age, gender and language, password and any parental control options.  We may also ask you to complete market research surveys.  If you are a Sub Account holder we will collect this information from the associated Master Account holder.</p>
    <p>Each time you sign in to PSN, we will collect information automatically without further notice to you, for example:</p>
   <ul class="hk">
	   <li>your IP address and device MAC address (the unique numbers which identify the network and device you are using) and the date and time of sign in</li>
	    <li>your system ID and information about the hardware you are using and how you have used it, such as model and serial number, parental control settings, photograph and music settings, remote play settings, information about devices connected to the hardware, how many items are stored on the hardware or have been used with the hardware and other related information.</li>
	    <li>information about how you use PSN, for example, what content you download, what services/advertisements you access and for how long, including how often you use chat, message boards or other  communication services </li>
	    <li>your gamer profile, game matching, uploaded scores and rankings, your Friends and block lists and your appearance on other user's Friends or block lists.</li>
	    <li>your offline gameplay information.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you buy funds for your SEN wallet, we will collect your payment details, such as credit card numbers, cardholder name, expiry date and security code, in order to process your payment.  Credit card details will be stored for future purchases, unless you remove them from your account via your SEN Account Management area.  We will keep a record of your payments into the wallet and the purchases you make using your wallet. </p>
    <h3>What do we do with your information?</h3>
    <p>We use your personal information to operate PSN and to provide the products and services you ask for, including online gaming, community features, communications, downloads, subscriptions, promotions and competitions.  We also use your personal information to deal with your customer service requests and to carry out business research and statistical analysis to improve our products and services and for marketing and promotional purposes.</p>
    <p>We use your personal information in order to process your purchases and carry out credit checks.  We may provide your payment details to banks and to any third party vendors relevant to a particular purchase in order to facilitate the completion of the purchase.  We keep records of transactions for our internal records and in order to comply with legal and accounting obligations. </p>
    <p>Your personal information will be retained by us and will be accessible to our employees, related companies, affiliates and any third parties (including advertisers, associated companies and contractors) engaged by us for and in relation to any of purpose for which your personal information was collected, as set out in this Privacy Policy.  By providing us with your personal information, you consent to the disclosure of your personal information to such third parties, and to any use of your personal information by such third parties which would, if the use was by us, be contemplated by or under this Privacy Policy.  We may also disclose, and you consent to our disclosure of, your personal information to our external agents and advisors for our internal auditing, accounting, compliance and legal purposes.</p>
     <p>From time to time, we will send you administration messages about PSN (for example, if you lose your password or to notify you of changes to the SEN Terms of Service and User Agreement (“the Conditions”) or this Privacy Policy).  We will also give you the option of receiving marketing information about new products, services and promotions, either from us or from other companies.  If you elect to receive such marketing information, then we may also use and disclose your personal information to relevant third parties for this purpose.</p>
     <p>We will use your information to enforce the Conditions and any other agreements in place between you and SCEH, as well as any rules or codes of conduct applying to your use of PSN.  In exceptional circumstances, we may use and/or disclose any of your information as required or permitted by law, to investigate complaints made by or against you, or to protect or defend ourselves, or others, against illegal, criminal or harmful activities.</p>
     <h3>Who else has access to your information?</h3>
     <p>Your information will be available to other Sony Computer Entertainment companies and companies who help us to operate the PSN (for example, companies who support our IT systems, process credit card payments, carry out credit checks and monitor communications for us).  We will take all reasonable steps to ensure that such companies comply with this Privacy Policy and we will be responsible for their use of your personal information.</p>
    <p>You may also be invited to use your SEN account details to log in to online game features, online services and websites offered by other companies who are not part of the Sony Computer Entertainment group, such as third party game publishers, social networking and game consolidation sites. If you use your SEN account to access these services, we will share your account details with those companies, so that they can operate these services, conduct their own research and analysis on these services and they may also market their products and services to you in accordance with applicable law. For example, we will share gameplay information and your parental control options with the publishers of games which you play online. We are not responsible for how these companies use or publish your personal information. They may have their own privacy policies governing how they will use your information, which we encourage you to access and read before using any service supported by them. By using your SEN account details to log in to third party websites or online services, you confirm that you want us to share your account details in this way. </p>
    <p>You should always take great care before providing your SEN account details to a third party as some sites may use your details to access your SEN account without your consent or for other fraudulent purposes. </p>
    <p>As PSN is a global service, your information will be transferred to other countries, such as countries in the European Economic Area (EEA), the United States and Japan, where data protection laws provide different levels of protection to the laws in place in your jurisdiction.  You consent to the cross jurisdictional transfer by us of your personal information to any country / area provided that the purpose of such transfer is a purpose of disclosure contemplated by this Privacy Policy. </p>
    <p>If our business is transferred to another company, your information may be transferred as part of the business.</p>
     <h3>“What’s New”</h3>
     <p>On some devices, such as PlayStation®3 systems, users may access a “What’s New” section that provides topical information about PSN and third party services as well as serves advertisements. Account holders who are logged into their accounts when they access “What’s New” will have advertisements delivered to them in that section based on their location. We will collect information from account holders who are logged into their account when they access &quot;What's New&quot;, including Online ID, country, date of birth/age and language, for the purpose of performing research and statistical analysis. We share this information with certain Sony group companies and third parties who assist in delivering these advertisements and support the “What’s New” service, solely for the purpose of performing business research and statistical analysis, except that Online IDs shall be hashed before they are shared with third parties, to ensure that they cannot be linked to a particular account holder, and date of birth will not be shared with third parties.</p>
    <p>If a user does not have a SEN account or is not logged into that account when accessing “What’s New,” that user will be asked to provide a country of residence, preferred language and date of birth/age. This information will be stored locally on the device and, if the user is eligible to receive advertising, will be shared, with Sony group companies and third parties who assist in delivering advertisements and supporting the “What’s New” service, solely for the purpose of performing business research and statistical analysis, except date of birth will not be shared with third parties. </p>
     <p>If you access the “What’s New” section, we will log information from your device to calculate the number of unique and repeat views of advertisements.  Logged data may include Online ID (for SEN account holders), length of time an advertisement was visible, size of the advertisement and other information related to each advertisement visible.  Logged data or some portion of it will be shared with Sony group companies and third parties who assist in delivering these advertisements and support the “What’s New” service solely for the purpose of conducting business research and statistical analysis, except that Online IDs shall be hashed before they are shared with third parties, to ensure that they cannot be linked to a particular account holder.</p>
    <h3>Monitoring of Communications</h3>
     <p>We reserve the right to monitor and record your online activity and communication on PSN and to remove any content from PSN at our sole discretion.  We may appoint other companies to do this for us.  However, we cannot monitor the entirety of PSN and we make no commitment to do so. </p>
    <h3>Changing Details and Unsubscribe</h3>
     <p>If you want to change or update your details, you can do so via your SEN Account Management area.  If you want to opt-out of receiving marketing information, you can also do so via your SEN Account Management area.</p>
     <h3>Cookies</h3>
     <p>Cookies are small text files which a website sends to your equipment.  We use cookies to recognise you when you log on to PSN and otherwise to operate PSN.  By accepting the Conditions and this Privacy Policy, you consent to our use of these cookies.</p>
    <h3>Security</h3>
     <p>We take appropriate steps to protect your personal information.  These include setting up processes to minimise unauthorised access to or disclosure of your information.  However, we do not guarantee that we will eliminate all risk of misuse of your personal information by intruders.  </p>
     <p>Certain information, which does not personally identify you, will be available to all PSN users. For example, your online ID, “About Me” statement, avatar pictures, country / area of residence, preferred language and recently played game titles. You should avoid disclosing any information which may identify you, or anyone else, in any public areas, such as messaging, chat and forums or during online play.</p>
    <p>If you have set your “Auto Sign-In” setting to populate automatically your password and Sign-in ID, please make sure you change the setting back before you let anyone else use your SEN account or give your PlayStation®3, PSP® (PlayStation®Portable) or PlayStation®Vita to anyone else.</p>
